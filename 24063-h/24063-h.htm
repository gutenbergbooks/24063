<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This book is intended to serve as a guide to the study of
grasses of the plains of South India. For the past few
years I have been receiving grasses for identification, almost
every week, from the officers of the Agricultural and Forest
Departments and others interested in grasses. The requirements
of these men and the absence of a suitable book
induced me to write this book.</p>

<p>I have included in this book about one hundred grasses
of wide distribution in the plains of South India. Many of
them occur also in other parts of India. The rarer grasses
of the plains and those growing on the hills are omitted, with
a view to deal with them separately.</p>

<p>The value of grasses can be realized from the fact that
man can supply all his needs from them alone, and their
importance in agriculture is very great, as the welfare of the
cattle is dependent upon grasses. Farmers, as a rule, take
no interest in them, although profitable agriculture is impossible
without grasses. Very few of them can give the names
of at least half a dozen grasses growing on their land. They
neglect grasses, because they are common and are found
everywhere. They cannot discriminate between them. To
a farmer "grass is grass" and that is all he cares to trouble
himself about. About grasses Robinson writes "Grass is
King. It rules and governs the world. It is the very foundation
of all commerce: without it the earth would be a
barren waste, and cotton, gold, and commerce all dead."</p>

<p>In the early days when the population was very much
limited and when land not brought under cultivation was
extensive plenty of green grasses was upon it and pastures
were numerous. So the farmer paid no attention to the
grasses, and it did not matter much. But now, population
has increased, unoccupied land has decreased very much and
the cattle have increased in number. Consequently he has
to pay more attention to grasses.</p>

<p>On account of the scarcity of fodder, people interested
in agriculture and cattle rearing have very often imported<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
foreign grasses and fodder plants into this country, but so
far no one has succeeded in establishing any one of them on
any large scale. Usually a great amount of labour and much
money is spent in these attempts. If the same amount of
attention is bestowed on indigenous grasses, better results
can be obtained with less labour and money. There are
many indigenous grasses that will yield plenty of stuff, if
they are given a chance to grow. The present deterioration
of grasses is mainly due to overgrazing and trampling by
men and cattle.</p>

<p>To prove the beneficial effects which result from preventing
overgrazing and trampling, Mr. G. R. Hilson, Deputy
Director of Agriculture (now Cotton Expert), selected some
portion of the waste land in the neighbourhood of the Farm
at Hagari and closed it for men and cattle. As a result of
this measure, in two years, a number of grasses and other
plants were found growing on the enclosed area very well,
and all of them seeded well. Of course the unenclosed areas
were bare as usual.</p>

<p>In the preparation of this book I received considerable
help from M.R.Ry. C. Tadulinga Mudaliyar Avargal, <span class="smcap">F.L.S.</span>,
Assistant Lecturing and Systematic Botanist, in the description
of species and I am indebted to M.R.Ry. P.S. Jivanna
Rao, <span class="smcap">M.A.</span>, Teaching Assistant, for assistance in proofreading.</p>

<p>I have to express my deep obligation to Mr. G. A. D.
Stuart, I.C.S., Director of Agriculture, for encouragement to
undertake this work and to the Madras Government for
ordering its publication.</p>

<p>For the excellence in the get up of the book I am
indebted to Mr. F. L. Gilbert, Superintendent, Government
Press.</p>

<h1><a name="A_HANDBOOK_OF_SOME_COMMON_SOUTH" id="A_HANDBOOK_OF_SOME_COMMON_SOUTH"></a>A HANDBOOK OF SOME COMMON SOUTH
INDIAN GRASSES.</h1>

INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>Grasses occupy wide tracts of land and they are evenly distributed
in all parts of the world. They occur in every soil, in all
kinds of situations and under all climatic conditions. In certain
places grasses form a leading feature of the flora. As grasses do
not like shade, they are not usually abundant within the forests
either as regards the number of individuals, or of species. But in
open places they do very well and sometimes whole tracts become
grass-lands. Then a very great portion of the actual vegetation
would consist of grasses.</p>

<p>On account of their almost universal distribution and their
great economic value grasses are of great importance to man.
And yet very few people appreciate the worth of grasses.
Although several families of plants supply the wants of man, the
grass family exceeds all the others in the amount and the value of
its products. The grasses growing in pasture land and the cereals
grown all over the world are of more value to man and his domestic
animals than all the other plants taken together.</p>

<p>To the popular mind grasses are only herbaceous plants with
narrow leaves such as the hariali, ginger grass and the kolakattai
grass. But in the grass family or Gramine&aelig; the cereals, sugarcane
and bamboos are also included.</p>

<p>Grasses are rather interesting in that they are usually successful
in occupying large tracts of land to the exclusion of other plants.
If we take into consideration the number of individuals of any
species of grass, they will be found to out-number those of any
species of any other family. Even as regards the number of
species this family ranks fifth, the first four places being occupied
respectively by Composit&aelig;, Leguminos&aelig;, Orchide&aelig; and Rubiace&aelig;.</p>

<p>As grasses form an exceedingly natural family it is very
difficult for beginners to readily distinguish them from one
another.</p>

<p>The leaves and branches of grasses are very much alike and the
flowers are so small that they are liable to be passed by unnoticed.
The recognition of even our common grasses is quite a task for a
botanist.</p>

<p>To understand the general structure of grasses and to become
familiar with them it is necessary to study closely some common
grasses. We shall begin our study by selecting as a type one of
the species of the genus Panicum.</p>

<p><i>Panicum javanicum</i> is an annual herb with stems radiating in all
directions from a centre. The plant is fixed to the soil by a tuft of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
fibrous roots all springing from the bases of the stems. In addition
to this crown of fibrous roots, there may be roots at the nodes of
some of the prostrate branches. The stems and branches are short
at first, and leaves arise on them one after the other in rapid succession.
After the appearance of a fair number of leaves the stem
elongates gradually and it finally ends in an inflorescence.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="fig1" id="fig1"></a>
<img src="images/fig001.jpg" width="500" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Panicum javanicum. (Full plant.)</p>

<p>The stem consists of <b>nodes</b> and <b>internodes</b>. The internodes
are cylindrical and somewhat flattened on the side towards the
axillary bud. When young they are completely covered by the
leaves and the older ones have only their lower portions covered
by the leaf-sheaths. Usually they complete their growth in length
very soon, but the lower portion of the internode, just above the
node and enclosed by the sheath, retains its power of growth for
some time.</p>

<p>The leaf consists of the two parts, the <b>leaf-sheath</b> and the <b>leaf-blade</b>.
At the junction of these two parts there is a very thin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
narrow membrane with fine hairs on its free margin. This is called
the <b>ligule</b>. (See fig. 2.)</p>

<p>The leaf-sheath is attached at its base to the node and it is
slightly swollen just above the place of insertion.
It covers the internode, one margin
being inside and the other outside. The
surface of the sheath is sparsely covered with
long hairs springing from small tubercles.
The outer margin of the sheath bears fine hairs
all along its length. (See fig. 2.)</p>

<p>The leaf-blade is broadly lanceolate, with
a tip finely drawn out. Its base is rounded and
the margin wavy, especially so towards the
base. On the margin towards the base long
hairs are seen, and some of these arise from
small tubercles. The margin has a hyaline
border which is very minutely serrate. There
is a distinct midrib and, on holding the leaf
against the light, four or five small veins come
in to view. In the spaces between these veins
lie many fine veins. All the veins run parallel
from the base to the apex. At the base of the
blade the veins get into the leaf-sheath and
therefore the sheath becomes striated. Just
above the ligule and at the base of the leaf-blade
there is a colourless narrow zone. This
is called the <b>collar</b>.</p>

of the leaf showing
1. the ligule and
2. the collar.</p>

<p>As already stated
the inflorescences appear
at the free ends
of branches. Every
branch sooner or later
terminates in an inflorescence
which is a
compound raceme.
There are usually five
or six racemes in the
inflorescence. Each
raceme has an axis,
called the <b>rachis</b>, which
bears unilaterally two
rows of bud-like bodies.
These bud-like bodies
are the units of the
inflorescence and they
are called <b>spikelets</b>.
(See fig. 3.)</p>

1. Inflorescence; 2 and 3. the front and the back
view of a raceme.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>The spikelets are softly hairy and are shortly stalked. The
pedicels of spikelets are hairy and sometimes one or two long
hairs are also found on them.
Each of these spikelets consists
of four green membranous structures
called <b>glumes</b>. The first
two glumes are unequal, the first
being very small. The second
and the third glumes are broadly
ovate-oblong with acute tips.
Both are of the same height and
texture, but the second is 7-nerved
and the third 5-nerved.
The fourth glume is membranous
when young, but later on it
becomes thick, coriaceous and
rugose at the surface. Just
opposite to the fourth glume there
is a flat structure with two nerves,
similar to the glume in texture.
This is called the <b>palea</b>. The
fourth glume and its palea adhere
together by their margins. Inside
the fourth glume and
between it and the palea there
are three stamens and an ovary
with two styles ending in feathery
stigmas. Just in front of the
ovary and outside the stamens
two very small scale-like bodies
are found. These are the <b>lodicules</b>. They are fleshy and well
developed in flowers that are about to open. In the spikelet there
is only one full flower. The third glume contains no flower in it,
but occasionally there may be in its axil three stamens. The first
two glumes are always empty and so they are called empty glumes.
(See fig. 4.) In mature spikelets the grain which is free is
enclosed by the fourth glume and its palea.</p>

THE VEGETATIVE ORGANS.</h2>


<p>Grasses vary very much in their habit. Some grasses grow
erect forming tufts and others form cushions with the branches
creeping along the ground. (See figs. 5 and 6.) We usually find
all intermediate stages from the erect to the prostrate habit.
Underground stems such as stolons and rhizomes occur in some
grasses. Grasses
of one particular
species generally
retain the same
habit but this
does not always
hold good. For
example <i>Tragus
racemosus</i> grows
with all its
branches quite
prostrate in a
poor, dry, open
soil. If, on the
other hand, this
happens to grow
in rich soils, or
amidst other
plants or grasses,
it assumes an
erect, somewhat
tufted habit.
<i>Andropogon contortus</i>
and <i>Andropogon pertusus</i> are other grasses with a tendency
for variation in habit. Plants that are usually small often attain
large dimensions under favourable conditions of growth. Ordinarily
the grass <i>Panicum javanicum</i> grows only to 1 or 2 feet. (See
fig. 1.) The same plant in a good rich soil grew to about 6 feet in
four months. (See fig. 7.)</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="fig5" id="fig5"></a>
<img src="images/fig005.jpg" width="500" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 5.&mdash;Eleusine &aelig;gyptiaca.</p>


<p>Some grasses are annual while others are perennial. It is often
difficult to determine whether a certain grass is annual or perennial.
But by examining the shoot-system this can be ascertained easily.
In an annual all the stems and branches usually end in inflorescences
and they will all be of the same year. If, on the other
hand, both young leafy branches and old branches ending in
inflorescences are found mixed, it must be a perennial grass. The
presence of the remains of old leaves, underground stolons and
rhizomes is also evidence showing the perennial character of the
plant.</p>

<p>Grasses are eminently adapted to occupy completely large
areas of land. They are also capable of very rapid extension over
large areas, on account of the production of stolons, rhizomes and
the formation of adventitious roots.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The root-system.</b>&mdash;The root-system of grasses is very striking
in its character. In most grasses, especially in erect ones, several
roots all of about the same diameter arise in a dense tuft from
nearly the
same level
and from the
lower-most
nodes of the
stems. The
roots are all
thin and
fibrous in the
vast majority
of these
plants, and
they are
tough and
wiry only in
a few cases
such as in the
case of the
roots of <i>Pennisetum
cenchroides</i>, <i>P.
Alopecuros</i>,
<i>Isch&aelig;mum
pilosum</i> and
<i>Andropogon
Sch&oelig;nanthus</i>.</p>

<p>On a close
examination
it will become
evident that
all the roots
of a grass
plant are
adventitious.
Inasmuch as the growth of the primary root is soon overtaken by
other roots growing from the stem, all the roots happen to be of the
same size. Roots arise from the nodes just above the insertion of
the leaf, and they grow piercing the leaf-sheath.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="fig6" id="fig6"></a>
<img src="images/fig006.jpg" width="500" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 6.&mdash;Panicum Crus-galli.</p>


<p>Grasses in which stolons and prostrate branches occur have, in
addition to the usual radiating crown of roots at the base, aerial
roots growing out of the upper nodes of the branches and fixing
them to the soil. Such roots become supporting or prop roots and
are particularly conspicuous in several stout tall grasses such as
<i>Andropogon Sorghum</i>, <i>Zea Mays</i> and <i>Pennisetum typhoideum</i>. (See
figs. 8 and 9.)</p>

<p>All the roots bear branch-roots which originate from the inner
portion of the mother roots in the usual manner. The character
and the extent of the development of the root-system is to a large
extent dependent upon the nature of the soil and its moisture
content. In light dry soils roots remain generally stunted and in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>well drained rich soils they attain their maximum development.
In clayey soils roots penetrate only to short distances. When
the soil is rich and sandy roots go deeper and extend in all directions.
The root-systems of most grasses are superficial and so are
best adapted for surface-feeding.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 7.&mdash;Panicum javanicum.</p>


<p><b>The shoot-system.</b>&mdash;The shoot-system varies with the duration
of the life of the plant. In annual grasses stems are in most cases
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>erect and even if they are not entirely so they become erect at the
time of flowering. They are attached to the soil by a tuft of
fibrous roots arising from the base of the stems. But in perennials
in addition to erect branches, creeping branches, stolons and
rhizomes may occur.</p>

<p>The stem is either cylindrical or compressed and consists of
nodes and internodes. In most grasses the internodes are usually
hollow, the cavity being lined by the remains of the original pith
cells. However, there are also grasses in which the stems remain
solid throughout. In many grasses the basal portions of stems are
more leafy and the internodes are short, but in the upper portions
the internodes become longer separating the leaves one from the
other.</p>

<p>In young shoots the leaves grow much faster than the internodes
and consequently internodes remain small, and leaves become very
conspicuous. The youngest portions of the shoots are by this
means always well protected by the surrounding leaf-sheaths.
As soon as leaves have grown fully, the internodes begin to
elongate rapidly separating the leaves. At first growth in length
takes place throughout its length in the internode and when it gets
older this elongation ceases. But, however, the lower portion of
the internode close to the node and which is enclosed by the leaf-sheath
retains its power of growth for a considerable time.</p>

<p>Branches arise from the axils of leaves and when a considerable
number of the axillary buds, especially from the lower nodes,
develop into branches the plant becomes tufted in habit. In most
grasses branches grow upwards through the sheath and emerge at
its mouth as aerial branches. Such branches are called <b>intravaginal</b>
branches or stems. But in some grasses axillary buds,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>instead of growing straight up through the sheath, pierce the leaf-sheath,
come out and then they grow out as branches. This may
be seen in the underground stolons of <i>Panicum repens</i> and in the
ordinary aerial branches of <i>Arundo Donax</i>. Branches that pierce
through the sheaths are called <b>extravaginal</b> branches. (See fig. 10.)</p>

<br />
1. Glabrous node; 2. bearded node;
3. node cut longitudinally.</p>


<p>The nodes are in most cases very conspicuous and they are
often found swollen. However, it must be remembered that the
enlargement at the node is not due to the increase in size of the
actual node, but due to growth in thickness of the base of the leaf-sheath.
(See fig. 11-3.) Nodes may be pale or coloured, glabrous,
hairy or bearded with long hairs. When the stem is erect the
nodes are short and of uniform size all round. But, if the stem is
bent down or tipped over by accident, the nodes begin to grow
longer on the lower side until a curvature sufficient to bring the
stem to the erect position is formed and then it ceases to grow.</p>

<p>As already noted some perennial grasses have creeping stems
and stolons, while others may have rhizomes. The grass <i>Cynodon
dactylon</i> develops several underground stolons which are covered
with white scale leaves and whose terminal buds are hard and
sharp so that they may be able to make their way through the soil.
The rhizomes when continuous and elongated are usually sympodia
formed by the lower portions of the aerial shoots. The aerial
shoot comes into the air and its lower portion is continued by a
branch arising from a lower leaf axil beneath the soil.</p>

<p><b>The leaf.</b>&mdash;Leaves are two-ranked and alternate, and very
often they become crowded at the lower portions of the shoots so
as to form basal tufts, though they are farther apart in the upper
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>portions of these shoots. Three distinct kinds of leaves are
met with in grasses. First, we have the fully formed foliage leaves
so characteristic of grasses. These are most conspicuous and are
formed in large numbers.</p>

<p>The other two kinds of leaves
are neither so conspicuous nor
so numerous as the foliage
leaves. At the base of shoots
occur abortive leaves which are
really rudimentary sheaths.
These are called <b>scales</b>. The
third kind of leaf is a modified
structure called the <b>prophyll</b> or
<b>prophyllum</b>. (See fig. 12.) It is
the first leaf occurring in every
branch on the side next to the
main shoot and it is a two-keeled
membranous structure resembling
somewhat the palea found
in the spikelets of grasses. The
portion of the prophyll between
the keels is concave due to the
pressure of the main stem, while
the sides beyond the keels bend
forward clasping the stem.</p>

<p>The ordinary foliage leaves of grasses consist of the two
parts, the flat expanded upper
portion called the <b>blade</b> and the
lower part called the <b>sheath</b> that
encircles the stem above the node
from which it arises. The leaf-sheaths
usually fit close to the
stem, but they may also be loose
or even inflated. Though the leaf-sheath
surrounds the internode
like a tube, it is not a closed tube.
It is really a flat structure rolled
firmly round the stem with one
edge overlapping the other. In
most cases it is cylindrical and it
may be compressed in a few cases.
Occasionally it may have a prominent
ridge or keel down its
back. The sheath may be glabrous
or hairy, smooth or striate
externally, and the outer margin
is often ciliate. In a few grasses
the sheaths become coloured
especially below or on the side
exposed to the sun.</p>

<p>The <b>ligule</b> is a structure peculiar to grasses and it varies very
much. In some grasses it is a distinct membrane narrow or broad,
with an even, truncate
or erose margin, or
finely ciliate. Very
often it is only a line or
fringe of hairs, whilst
in some it may be entirely
absent as in the
leaves of <i>Panicum colonum</i>.
When it is a membrane it may be
broad and oblong,
ovate and obtuse, or
lanceolate and acute.
(See fig. 13.) The function
of the ligule is
probably to facilitate
the shedding of water
which may run down
the leaf, and thus
lessen the danger of
rotting of the stem
which is sure to follow,
if the water were to find its way into the interior of the sheath.
Sometimes, in addition to the ligule, other appendages may be
present in grass leaves as in <i>Oryza sativa</i>. Such outgrowths are
called <b>auricles</b> or <b>auricular outgrowths</b>. (See fig. 13.)</p>

<p>The leaf-blade is well developed in the foliage leaves and in
most cases it follows directly on the sheath. But in bamboos and
some species of Isch&aelig;mum there occurs a short petiole or stalk
between the leaf-blade and the sheath. The sheath corresponds
morphologically to the leaf base of a leaf of other flowering plants.</p>

<br />
1 and 2. Finely serrate; 3. glandular; 4 and 5. very minutely
serrate; 6. very minutely serrate and ciliate.</p>


<p>In grasses the leaf-blades usually grow more in length than in
any other direction and there is no limit to the length they may
attain. Some
grasses have
very short leaves,
others very long
ones. The leaf-blade
in most
grasses is more
or less of some
elongated form,
such as linear,
linear-lanceolate,
lanceolate, etc.
(See fig. 14.)
In a few grasses
the leaf-blade is
ovate, but this is a rare condition. Therefore, in noting the general
shape of the leaf-blade the relation of the length to the breadth,
the amount of tapering towards the apex and base and the nature
of the apex should be considered.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>The veins in the leaf-blade can usually be seen on holding the
leaf up to the light. All the veins run parallel. In most cases
the midrib is prominent and in some cases there may be also a
distinct keel. Amongst the veins running through the leaf-blade
some are large and prominent, while others are small and not conspicuous.
On account of this disparity, very often, ridges and
furrows become prominent on the upper or lower, or on both the
surfaces of the leaf-blades. Generally the two surfaces of the
leaf-blade are distinct, and they may be glabrous or hairy. In
most grasses the surfaces are rough or scabrid to the touch owing
to the presence of regular rows of exceedingly fine sharp pointed
minute hairs.</p>

<p>The apex of the blade is generally sharp and pointed, acute or
acuminate, or sometimes it may be drawn to a very fine point by
gradual tapering. Blunt or obtuse tips are not altogether absent,
but it is not a common feature. The leaf-blades in <i>Panicum colonum</i>
and in some species of Andropogon are rounded or obtuse at the
apex.</p>

<p>The margins of the leaf-blade are somewhat hyaline and they
may be perfectly even or cut into serrations of fine teeth in various
ways. (See fig. 15.) In addition to these minute teeth, there may
be long or short cilia. Sometimes the margins are glandular as in
<i>Eragrostis Willdenoviana</i> and <i>Eragrostis major</i>.</p>

<p>The base of the leaf may be narrower, broader than, or about
the same as the breadth of the leaf-sheath. It may be rounded,
amplexicaul or narrowed. At the base and just above the ligular
region there will always be a white distinct zone in the lamina of
all grasses called the collar. This collar varies in length and
breadth according to the species of grass.</p>

<p>In young shoots all the leaf-blades are usually found folded at
the terminal portions. In most cases
the leaf-blade is rolled up inwards from
one end to the other so that one margin
is inside and the other outside. This
folding is termed <b>convolute</b>. This is
the kind of folding that is found in
most grasses. However, there are some
grasses such as <i>Eleusine &aelig;gyptiaca</i> and
<i>Chloris barbata</i>, in which the folding is
different. In these grasses the laminas
are folded flat on their midribs so that
each half of the blade is folded flat on
the other, the inner surfaces being in
contact. The leaves are said to be
<b>conduplicate</b> in this case. When the
leaves are conduplicate the shoots are
more or less compressed. (See fig. 16.)</p>

THE INFLORESCENCE AND FLOWER.</h2>


<p>The flowers of grasses are reduced to their essential organs,
the stamens and the pistil. The flowers are aggregated together
on distinct shoots constituting the inflorescence of grasses.
Sooner or later all the branches of a grass-plant terminate in
inflorescences which usually stand far above the foliage leaves.
As in other flowering plants, in grasses also different forms of
inflorescence are met with. But in grasses the unit of the inflorescence
is the <b>spikelet</b> and not the flower.</p>

<p>The forms of inflorescence usually met with are the spike,
raceme and panicle. When the spikelets are sessile or borne
directly along an elongated axis as in <i>Enteropogon melicoides</i> the
inflorescence is a <b>spike</b>. If the spikelets borne by the axis are all
stalked, however short the pedicels may be, it is a <b>raceme</b>. It
must, however, be remembered that true spikes are very rare. An
inflorescence may appear to be a spike, but on a close examination
it will be seen to consist of spikelets more or less pedicelled.
Such an inflorescence, strictly speaking, is a <b>spiciform raceme</b>.
The branches of the inflorescence in <i>Paspalum scrobiculatum</i> or
<i>Panicum javanicum</i> are racemes and the whole inflorescence is a
compound raceme. The inflorescence is a <b>panicle</b> when the
spikelets are borne on secondary, tertiary or further subdivided
branches. Panicles differ very much in appearance according to
the relative length and stoutness of the branches. In <i>Eragrostis
tremula</i> the panicle is very diffuse, in <i>Eragrostis Willdenoviana</i>
less so. The panicle in <i>Sporobolus coromandelianus</i> is pyramidal
and the branches are all verticillate, the lower being longer than
the upper. The branches of a panicle are usually loose, spreading
or drooping in most grasses. But in some species of grasses such
as <i>Pennisetum Alopecuros</i> and <i>Setaria glauca</i>, the paniculate inflorescences
become so contracted that the pedicels and the short
branches are hidden and the inflorescence appears to be a spike.
Such inflorescences as these are called <b>spiciform panicles</b>. The
inflorescences in several species of Andropogon consist of racemes
so much modified as to appear exactly like a spike. What looks
like a spike in these cases consists of a jointed axis and each joint
bears a pair of spikelets, one sessile and the other pedicelled.</p>

<p>The name <b>rachis</b> is given to the axis of the spike, raceme and
panicle, whether the axis is the main one or of the branch. The
rachis of the inflorescence is usually cylindrical. In some grasses
it is zigzag as in <i>Pennisetum cenchroides</i>. It is very much
flattened in <i>Paspalum scrobiculatum</i>, but somewhat trigonous in
<i>Digitaria sanguinalis</i>. In very many grasses the rachis is continuous,
but in a few cases it consists of internodes or joints which
disarticulate at maturity. Many species of Andropogon have such
jointed rachises. Sometimes the joints become greatly thickened
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>and the surface hollowed out, the spikelets fitting in the cavities
as in Rottboellia and Manisuris.</p>

<p>In panicles, especially when they are diffuse, the primary
branches may be disposed irregularly or in verticils on the main
axis. For example in the panicle of <i>Eragrostis Willdenoviana</i>,
the branches are irregularly disposed, whereas in <i>Sporobolus
coromandelianus</i> the branches are verticillate. In both these
grasses fleshy cushions are developed in the axils of the branches.
These swellings help to spread out the branches especially at the
time of anthesis. The branches at the top spread out earlier than
those below.</p>

<p>Sometimes at the base of the rachises, main or secondary,
glandular streaks are seen as in the rachises of <i>Sporobolus coromandelianus</i>.
These glands secrete a viscid juice at the time of
anthesis.</p>

<br />
1 and 2. Empty glumes; 3, 4, 5, and 6.
flowering glumes with flowers.</p>


<p>The <b>spikelet</b> may be considered as a specialised branch
consisting of a short axis, the
<b>rachilla</b> bearing a series of
modified bracts, the <b>glumes</b>, the
lower pair being empty but the
others bearing flowers in their
axils. The glumes are two-ranked
and imbricating. As a
type for the spikelet that of an
Eragrostis or Dinebra may be
chosen. (See fig. 17.) In this
spikelet the rachilla bears a
number of glumes alternating
and imbricating. The first two
glumes at the base of the
spikelet do not bear any flowers
and so these two glumes are
usually called empty glumes.
This is the case in almost all the
species of grasses. The third
and the subsequent glumes are
regularly arranged on the slender rachilla alternately in two rows.
In the axils of each of these glumes there is a flower, except
perhaps in the topmost glume. The flower is usually enclosed by
the glume and another structure found opposite the glume and
differing very much from the glume. This is the <b>palea</b>. It is
attached to the axis of the flower and its back is towards the
rachilla. Generally there are two nerves in a palea and its
margins are enclosed within those of the glume. The palea is
homologous with the prophyllum which it very much resembles.
The prophyllum is usually found in the branches of grasses, but it
is not confined to grasses alone. It occurs in the branches of some
species of Commelina.</p>

<p>The spikelets vary very much in their structure. The spikelets
in grasses of several genera consist of only four glumes. As usual
the first two glumes are empty and the remaining two are
flower-bearing glumes. Both these glumes may have perfect flowers as
in Isachne or the terminal one may contain a perfect flower, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>lower having either a staminate flower or only a palea. Very
often the spikelets are unisexual and the male and female spikelets
may be on the same plant as in <i>Coix Lachryma-Jobi</i> and <i>Polytoca
barbata</i>, or they may be on different plants as in <i>Spinifex squarrosus</i>.</p>

<p>The glumes of a spikelet are really modified bracts and some
differentiate the flowering glumes from the empty ones, by giving
them different names. The first two empty glumes are called glumes
by all agrostologists. Some in Europe call the flowering glume
lower palea to distinguish it from the real palea which they call the
upper palea. Some American Authors have recently adopted for
the flowering glume the term <b>lemma</b> introduced by Piper.</p>

<p>Considerable variation is met with in the case of the empty
glumes. Generally they are unequal, the first being smaller. Very
often the first glume becomes very small and it may be altogether
absent. In some species of Panicum the first glume is very small,
in Digitaria it is very minute and in Paspalum and Eriochloa it is
entirely suppressed. The flowering glumes are generally uniform
when there are many. In the spikelet having only four glumes
the fourth glume differs from the others mainly in texture. Instead
of being thin and herbaceous it becomes rigid and hard, smooth
or rugose externally as in Panicum. Flowering glumes instead of
being like empty glumes, become very thin, shorter and hyaline in
Andropogon. Sometimes the flowering glumes are awned. All of
them may be awned as in Chloris or only the fourth glume as in
Andropogon.</p>

<p>The palea is fairly uniform in its structure in many grasses, but
it is also subject to variation. It becomes shorter in some and is
absent in others. Instead of having two nerves, it may have one
and rarely more than two. The palea can easily be distinguished
from the glume, because its insertion in the spikelet is different
from that of the glume.</p>

<br />
1. lodicules;
2. stamens; 3. ovary.</p>


<p>The <b>lodicules</b> are small organs and they are the vestiges of
the perianth. In most grasses there are only
two, but in Ochlandra and other bamboos we
meet with three lodicules. There are also
some species with many lodicules. In shape
they are mostly of some form referable to the
cuneate form. They are of somewhat
elongated form in Aristida and Chloris. The
function of the lodicules seems to be to separate
the glume and its palea so as to enable the
stamens to come out and hang freely at the
time of anthesis. So it is only at the time of
the opening of the flowers that the lodicules
are at their best. Then they are fairly large,
fleshy and thick and conspicuous. In the bud
stage they are usually small and after the
opening of the flower they shrivel up and are
inconspicuous. There are also species of
grasses in which the lodicules are not found.</p>

<p>The <b>stamens</b> are three in number in the majority of grasses and
six are met with in Leersia, Hygrorhiza and Bamboos. Each
stamen consists of a very delicate long filament and an anther
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>basifixed to the filament. But as the anthers are long and the
connective is reduced to its minimum, they appear as if versatile
when the stamens are out. When there are three stamens one
stands in front of the flowering glumes and the other two in front
of the palea, one opposite each edge of the palea. The relative
positions of the parts of the floret are shown in the floral diagrams.
(See figs. 18 and 19.)</p>

</div>

<br />
The first is that of Chloris, second of Panicum and the third of Oryza.</p>


<p>The <b>pistil</b> consists of an ovary and two styles ending in plumose
stigmas. The ovary is 1-celled and 1-ovuled. It is one carpelled
according to the views of Hackel and his followers and there are
also some who consider it as 3-carpelled because of the occurrence
of three styles in the pistil of some bamboos.</p>

<p>The <b>rachilla</b> is usually well developed and elongated in many-flowered
spikelets, while in 1-flowered spikelets it remains very
small so that the flower appears to be terminal. It often extends
beyond the insertion of the terminal flower and its glume, and then
lies hidden appressed to the palea. This may be seen in the spikelets
of the species of Cynodon. This prolonged rachilla sometimes
bears a minute glume, which is of course rudimentary. Usually
the glumes are rather close together on the rachilla so that the
internodes are very short; but in some grasses, as in <i>Dinebra
arabica</i>, the glumes are rather distant and so the internodes are
somewhat longer and conspicuous. In some species of Panicum
the rachilla is jointed to the pedicel below the empty glumes,
whereas it is articulated just above these glumes in <i>Chloris barbata</i>.
Sometimes the rachilla is articulated between the flowers. This
is the case in the spikelet of <i>Dinebra arabica</i>.</p>

<p>Pollination in most grasses is brought about by wind, though
in a few cases self-pollination occurs. The terminal position of the
inflorescence, its protrusion far above the level of the foliage leaves,
the swinging and dangling anthers, the abundance of non-sticking
pollen and the plumose stigmas are all intended to facilitate pollination
by wind. Furthermore the stamens and the stigmas do
not mature at the same time. In some grasses the stamens mature
earlier, (<b>protandry</b>) while in others the stigmas protrude long before
the stamens (<b>protogyny</b>). As the result of the pollination
the ovary developes into a dry 1-seeded indehiscent fruit. The
seed fills the cavity fully and the pericarp fuses with the seed-coat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>and so they are inseparable. Such a fruit is termed a <b>caryopsis</b> or
<b>grain</b>. Though in the vast majority of grasses the pericarp is
inseparable, in a few cases it is free from the seed-coat as in
<i>Sporobolus indicus</i> and <i>Eleusine indica</i>.</p>

<p>The caryopsis consists of an embryo on one side at the base
and the endosperm occupies the remaining portion. The embryo
can be made out on the side of the grain facing the glume, as it is
outlined as an oval area. On the other face of the grain which is
towards the palea, the hilum is seen at the base. The grain varies
in shape considerably. It may be rounded, oval, ellipsoidal, narrow
and cylindrical, oblong terete or furrowed. There is considerable
variation as regards the colour also.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>The <b>embryo</b> consists of an <b>axis</b> and a <b>scutellum</b>. The axis,
which is differentiated into the plumule directed upward and
the radicle downward, is small and straight and it is covered
more or less by the edges of the scutellum. The scutellum is
attached to the axis at about its middle and its outer surface is in
contact with the endosperm. This is an important organ as its
function is to absorb nourishment from the endosperm during
germination. The scutellum is considered to represent the first
leaf or cotyledon. The endosperm consists mostly of starch. Just
outside the endosperm and within the epidermis lies a layer of
cells containing much proteid substance. This layer is called the
<b>aleurone layer</b>. (See fig. 21.) As an illustration of the caryopsis,
the grain of Andropogon Sorghum may be studied. All the structural
details are shown in fig. 20 which is a longitudinal section
of the grain.</p>

<p>The primary axis of the embryo is enclosed by a closed sheath
both above and below. The sheath which envelopes the radicle is
called <b>coleorhiza</b> and that of the plumule, <b>pileole</b> or <b>germ-sheath</b>.</p>

HISTOLOGY OF THE VEGETATIVE ORGANS.</h2>


<p>The shoots and roots of grasses conform in their internal
structure to the monocotyledonous type. In all grasses numerous
threads are found running longitudinally within the stem and some
of these pass into the leaves, at the nodes, and run as nerves in the
blades of the leaves. These threads are the vascular bundles.
The rest of the tissue of the stem and leaves consists of thin-walled
parenchymatous cells of different sorts.</p>

<p>The general structure of these bundles is more or less the same
in all grasses. A vascular
bundle consists of only
xylem and phlo&euml;m, without
the cambium, and so no
secondary thickening can
take place in the stems of
grasses. Such bundles as
these are called <b>closed
vascular bundles</b> to distinguish
them from the dicotyledonous
type of vascular
bundles which are called
<b>open vascular bundles</b> on
account of the existence of
the cambium.</p>

<p>The component parts and
elements of which the vascular
bundles in grasses are
composed may be learnt
by studying the transverse
and longitudinal
sections of these bundles
in any grass. The cross
and longitudinal sections
of a vascular bundle of the
stem of <i>Pennisetum cenchroides</i>,
are shown in figs.
22 and 23. In the figure of
the transverse section the
two large cavities indicated
by the number 3 and the two small circular cavities with thick
walls lying between the larger ones and indicated by the numbers
1 and 2 are the chief elements of the xylem.</p>

<p>By looking at the longitudinal section it is obvious that these
elements are really vessels, the larger being pitted and the smaller
annular and spiral vessels. These vessels together with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>numerous small thick-walled cells lying between the pitted vessels
constitute the xylem. Just above the xylem there is a group of
large and small thin-walled cells. This is the phlo&euml;m and it
consists of sieve tubes and thin-walled cells. All round the xylem
and the phlo&euml;m there are many thick-walled cells. These are
really fibres forming the <b>bundle-sheath</b>. On account of this
bundle-sheath the bundles are called <b>fibro-vascular bundles</b>.</p>

<p><b>Structure of the stem.</b>&mdash;The stem of a grass consists of a mass
of parenchymatous cells with a number of fibro-vascular bundles
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>imbedded in it, and it is covered externally by a protective layer
of cells, the epidermis. The stem is usually solid in all grasses in
the young stage, but as it matures the internodes become hollow
in many grasses and they remain solid in a few. In the internodes
the fibro-vascular bundles run longitudinally and are parallel, but
in the nodes they run in all directions and form a net work from
which emerge a few bundles to enter the leaves. So far as the
broad general features are concerned, the stems of many grasses are
more or less similar in structure. However, when we take into consideration
the arrangement of bundles, the development and arrangement
of sclerenchyma, every species of grass has its own special
characteristics. And these are so striking and constant that it
may be possible to identify the species from these characters alone.</p>

<p>We may take as a type the stem of <i>Rottboellia exaltata</i>. This
stem is somewhat semi-circular in transverse section and it is
almost straight and flat in the front (the side towards the axillary
bud). The peripheral portion of the stem becomes somewhat
rigid and thick due to the aggregation of vascular bundles, some
small and others large. The outermost series of bundles consisting
of small and larger bundles are in contact with the layers of the
cells lying just beneath the epidermis and these cells are also
thick-walled. A few are away from these being separated by three
or four layers of cells from the peripheral bundles. In all these
vascular bundles the bundle-sheath is very strongly developed all
round and is very much developed especially at the sides. It is
this great development of sclerenchyma that makes the outer
portion of the cortex hard. Within the ground tissue are found a
number of vascular bundles scattered more or less uniformly.
These bundles have no continuous bundle-sheaths but have instead
groups of fibres at the sides and in front of the phlo&euml;m. The
cavities near the annular vessels are somewhat larger and conspicuous
in these bundles.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 25.&mdash;Transverse section of the stem of Pennisetum cenchroides. &times; 20</p>


<p>The epidermal cells are all thickened very much and the outer
layer is cutinized and impregnated with silica. This is the case in
the epidermis of the stems and leaves of most grasses. (See fig. 24.)</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to give a general idea of the variations in the structure
of the stem in grasses a few examples are chosen and the details
of the structure of the stems of these grasses are dealt with here.</p>

<p>The stem of <i>Pennisetum cenchroides</i> is somewhat round in outline
in the transverse section with a slight curvature in the front. The
vascular bundles are rather numerous and irregularly scattered all
over the ground tissue. The
peripheral bundles are not so
close to the periphery of the stem
as in <i>Rottboellia exaltata</i>. These
are separated from the epidermis
by several layers of parenchymatous
cells. Further, these peripheral
bundles are all imbedded
in a continuous sclerenchymatous
band which runs round the stem
in the form of a ring. The epidermal cells as well as the
layer of cells in immediate
contact with it are thick-walled.
In the vascular bundles of the
ground tissue the bundle-sheath
is rather prominent and the
phlo&euml;m portion is well developed.
(See figs. 25 and 26.)</p>

<p>In the stem of <i>Eriochloa polystachya</i>, all the vascular bundles
are more or less peripheral in position leaving a wide area of
parenchymatous cells in the centre. The outline of the stem in
cross section is rotund or ovate-rotund with the front side somewhat
flattened and straight. The epidermal cells alone are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>thickened. A well developed continuous ring of sclerenchyma is
present and this is connected with the epidermal layer at short
intervals by means of short sclerenchymatous bands. So the
parenchymatous cells of the cortex lying outside the sclerenchymatous
ring are divided into small isolated areas. There are three
series of vascular bundles.</p>

<p>One series consists of small bundles lying inside the sclerenchyma

second series is made up of large vascular bundles imbedded
in the ring so as to bulge out inside the ring. The vascular

<p>Another stem in which the vascular bundles are more or less
peripheral in position and enclosing a wide parenchyma is that of
<i>Setaria glauca</i>. In the transverse section of the stem the outline is
ovate, laterally compressed, obtusely keeled at the back and
somewhat concave in the front. The sclerenchymatous band is
narrow and continuous and very close to the epidermis, being
separated from it only by two or three layers of thin-walled cells.
The epidermal cells alone are thickened. As to the vascular
bundles there are three sets. One set of bundles lying just outside
the sclerenchymatous ring consists of small ones connecting the
ring with the epidermis. Just inside the sclerenchymatous ring
lies a series of bundles which are connected with it. Still inside, at
some distance from the sclerenchymatous band, are seen vascular
bundles forming a row and enclosing a large space of the ground
tissue consisting of only parenchyma. (See figs. 29 and 30.)</p>

One set of bundles is imbedded in the band, and another set
just touches the inner border of it. A third series is disposed
around a fairly large amount of ground tissue, which may or may
not have a cavity in the centre. The stem of <i>Eragrostis</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
<i>interrupta</i> has more or less the same structure, but the cortex has air
spaces here and there. Other minor differences may be seen on

<p>The stems of grasses growing in wet or marshy situations differ
in structure from those detailed above. As examples the stems of
<i>Panicum flavidum</i>, <i>Panicum colonum</i>, <i>Panicum Crus-galli</i> and <i>Panicum
fluitans</i> may be considered. The stem of <i>Panicum flavidum</i> is
broadly ovate in cross section with a flat front and is more or less
solid, though occasionally the parenchymatous cells in the centre
get broken. Two rows of vascular bundles surround a fairly large
amount of parenchymatous cells of the ground tissue. There is a
continuous ring of sclerenchyma separated from the epidermis by
a fairly broad cortex. The cortex has a number of fairly large air-cavities
separated by bands of parenchymatous cells. Within the
sclerenchymatous band lie small vascular bundles at regular intervals
just towards the cortex. A few isolated bundles are in contact
with the inner border. (See figs. 37 and 38.)</p>

<p>The stems of <i>Panicum colonum</i>, <i>Panicum stagninum</i> and <i>Panicum
Crus-galli</i> have in their centre in the ground tissue stellate cells
with air-cavities. This part is surrounded by a fairly broad
portion of parenchymatous cells in which are imbedded two rows
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>of bundles. Outside these bundles runs round the stem a narrow
sclerenchymatous band with a few bundles in it of which some
touch it inside and others outside. Two bundles are found by
themselves in the tissue of stellate cells. In <i>Panicum Crus-galli</i>
three or four bundles are met with amidst the stellate cells.</p>

at the sides and very broad in front and at the back. The
sclerenchymatous ring is circular in outline. The stem of <i>Panicum

epidermal cells as well as the lower cells are thickened in the stems
of <i>Panicum fluitans</i> and <i>Panicum Crus-galli</i>, but in the stems of

<p>The stem of <i>Panicum fluitans</i> is round in outline in the transverse
section and has a large cavity. Just close to the cavity and
separated from it by only one or two parenchymatous cells are
found vascular bundles forming a series. Outside this series of
bundles lies a sclerenchymatous band which is wavy, following
the lower edges of the large air-cavities. One series of bundles
is connected with this sclerenchymatous ring. The air-cavities
are large and uniform and are separated by bands of parenchymatous
cells. In each of these bands lies a vascular bundle on the
upper side near the periphery. Sometimes we find, especially in
young stages, diaphragms of stellulate cells stretched across the
air-cavities. Later as the stem matures these disappear and the
cavities become conspicuous. (See figs. 42 and 43.)</p>

<p><b>Structure of the root.</b>&mdash;As already stated, the roots of grasses
conform to the monocotyledonous type, but the variations met with
in their structure are not so great as in the case of the stem. The
root-tips are protected by root-caps, and the actual tip of the root
is very distinct in the roots of all grasses and it can be seen very
clearly in a longitudinal section of the root. The actual tip of the
root is sharply distinct from the root-cap as there are two distinct
sets of cells, one giving rise to the root-tip and the other to the
root-cap.</p>

<p>The young root-tips are always free from root-hairs, and they
are confined to the portions behind the root-tips. The extent of
the root-hair region will vary according to the vigour and development
of the roots and the nature of the soil. The root-hairs are
mere protrusions of the cells of the outermost layer of the cortex
of the root and this layer is called the <b>piliferous layer</b>.</p>

<p>To learn the structure of the roots of grasses we may select as
types the roots of <i>Pennisetum cenchroides</i> and <i>Andropogon Sorghum</i>
and consider their structural details. In the transverse sections of
these roots we find
a fairly broad
cortex consisting
of thin-walled
parenchymatous
cells more or less
regularly arranged.
(See figs. 44 and
45.) Just below the
piliferous layer two
or three layers of
thick-walled cells
are seen. In the
roots of <i>Andropogon
Sorghum</i> these
thick-walled cells
are very conspicuous
as they consist
of several
layers. These
layers of thick-walled
cells constitute
the <b>exodermis</b>.
(See fig. 46.)
The innermost
layer of cells of the cortex is called the <b>endodermis</b> and it becomes
conspicuous on account of the thickening in the lateral and inner
walls of the cells of this layer. (See figs. 44 and 47.)</p>

The arrangement of the

on different radii, and not
one behind the other on the
same radius as in the stem.

groups is fairly large and
the development of the
xylem is from the pericycle
towards the centre of the
stele. (See figs. 44 and 45.)
The parenchymatous cells
in the centre of the stele
become thick-walled in
older roots.</p>

<p><b>Structure of the leaf.</b>&mdash;The structure of the leaf of grasses is
quite characteristic of the family. In every leaf a number of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>vascular bundles, some small and others large, pass from the
base to the apex. Externally the leaf is covered on both the
sides by the epidermis. The spaces existing between the vascular
bundles and the epidermis
are filled with
parenchymatous cells.
The larger vascular
bundles consist of
xylem and phlo&euml;m surrounded
by a bundle
sheath of a single layer
of cells. In the smaller
bundles the xylem is
very much reduced.
Around every vascular
bundle there is a
single row of somewhat
large cells densely
packed with large chloroplasts,
the <b>chlorophyllous
layer</b>. The
vascular bundles are
strengthened by fibres,
on both the sides in the
case of larger bundles
and on only one side in
small bundles.</p>

<p>For a detailed study of the structure of the leaves of grasses
the leaf of the grass <i>Panicum javanicum</i> may be chosen. In a
transverse section of this leaf, the vascular bundles are very
conspicuous. The larger bundles are normal in every way, while in
the smaller ones the xylem elements are considerably reduced.
Around every one of the vascular bundles there is a single row of
large cells containing large chlorophyll grains (the chlorophyllous
layer). In a well developed large vascular bundle the chlorophyllous
layer is open below just close to the sclerenchymatous band.
On both sides of the larger vascular bundle there are bands of
sclerenchyma. In the case of smaller bundles some are strengthened
by sclerenchyma on the lower side and others have none.
The spaces between the bundles are occupied by thin-walled
parenchymatous cells containing small chlorophyll grains.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 50.&mdash;Lower epidermis of the leaf of Panicum javanicum. &times; 300</p>


<p>The lower epidermis of the leaf in the transverse section is even
and consists of small and large round cells. The upper epidermis
is slightly wavy and it is made up of some small round cells
alternating with groups of larger cells. The epidermal cells lying
over sclerenchyma and the smaller vascular bundles are small
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>and round, while those lying over the furrows between the vascular
bundles are large and are called <b>motor</b> or <b>bulliform cells</b>. The
presence of motor cells is a characteristic feature of the leaves of
many grasses.</p>

<p>The continuity of both the upper and the lower epidermis is
interrupted by the stomata. Air-cavities are seen below these
stomata. The arrangement of the stomata, the shape of the guard
cells and the characteristics of the epidermal cells become clear on
examining a piece of epidermis. (See figs. 49 and 50.)</p>

<p>The structure of the leaf of <i>Panicum javanicum</i> may be taken as
typical of the structure of the leaves of most grasses. The leaves
of <i>Eriochloa polystachya</i>, Cynodon and Paspalums are very much
like the leaves of <i>Panicum javanicum</i> in their internal structure.</p>

<p>Considerable amount of variation, however, occurs in the leaves
of grasses especially as regards the arrangement of fibres and motor
cells.</p>

<p>Every large primary vascular bundle in the leaves of many
grasses possesses sclerenchymatous bands both above and below.
The other vascular bundles may have bands of sclerenchyma on
both sides or on one side only or none. For example, in the leaves
of <i>Panicum repens</i> both the primary and secondary bundles are
provided with sclerenchyma on both the sides, while those of the
third order may have it on one side or not. The hyaline margin
of this leaf and of the leaves of other grasses consists entirely of
sclerenchyma. (See fig. 53.)</p>

<p>All the vascular bundles in the leaves of <i>Aristida setacea</i> have
broad sclerenchymatous bands on both the sides. Besides these
bands arranged like a girder above and below each bundle, there
are on the lower side bands of sclerenchyma. So the sclerenchyma
becomes almost continuous on the lower side.</p>

<p>The sclerenchyma lying on the lower side of the primary
bundles are contiguous with the bundle, while those above are
separated from the bundle by the chlorophyllous layer. (See fig. 55.)
In the case of secondary and tertiary bundles the sclerenchymatous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>bands lying on the lower side are in contact with the chlorophyllous
layer, whereas the upper bands are either in contact with this
layer or separated from it by a few parenchymatous cells.</p>

<p>All the vascular bundles in the leaves of <i>Eragrostis Willdenoviana</i>
are provided with sclerenchyma on both the sides. The
lower band of the primary vascular bundles is continuous with the
vascular bundle, the chlorophyllous layer being open below. The
upper bands of the primary and the lower bands of the secondary
vascular bundles just touch the chlorophyllous layer. In the
secondary bundles the sclerenchyma band above is separated from
the chlorophyllous layer by two layers of parenchyma. In the
case of the leaves of <i>Panicum flavidum</i>, <i>P. colonum</i>, <i>P. fluitans</i> and
<i>Pennisetum cenchroides</i> the sclerenchyma is separated from the
chlorophyllous layer by layers of parenchyma.</p>

<p>Even from the few examples dealt with above, it is obvious that
the range of variation of sclerenchyma in leaves is very great. In
the leaves of <i>Aristida setacea</i> there is a considerable amount of
sclerenchyma whilst in some leaves such as those of <i>Panicum</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
<i>colonum</i>, <i>P. flavidum</i> and <i>Panicum fluitans</i> the sclerenchyma is
reduced to its minimum.</p>

<p>In the leaves of grasses growing in dry situations the development
of sclerenchyma is generally very considerable. The grass
<i>Aristida setacea</i> is a good example of a xerophytic grass. The sea-shore
grass <i>Spinifex squarrosus</i> is another example of the same
kind. But in the leaves of this grass, the development of sclerenchyma
is not very considerable, but there is a great development
of parenchymatous cells free from chlorophyll within the leaf, the
chlorophyll bearing cells being confined to the upper and the lower
surfaces of the leaves.</p>

<p>The upper and the lower surfaces of the leaves of many grasses
are more or less even, but in the case of a few grasses the upper
surface consists of ridges and furrows, instead of being even. In
the leaves of <i>Panicum repens</i> and <i>Eragrostis Willdenoviana</i> the upper
surface is wavy and consists of shallow furrows and slightly raised
ridges. But in the leaves of <i>Aristida setacea</i> and <i>Panicum fluitans</i>
the furrows are deeper and the ridges are more prominent. In
<i>Aristida setacea</i> the ridges are flat-topped and they are rounded
with broad furrows in <i>Panicum fluitans</i>.</p>

<p>The epidermis covering the leaves consists of elongated cells
with plane or sinuous walls, various kinds of short cells intercalated
between the ends of long cells, motor-cells and stomata. Hairs of
different sorts occur as outgrowths of the epidermis. The roughness
of the surface of the leaves of grasses is due to the presence
of very minute short hairs borne by the epidermis. In most cases
these short hairs are found in regular rows. Although the epidermis
is more or less even in the leaves of several grasses such as
<i>Panicum repens</i>, <i>P. flavidum</i> and <i>Eriochloa polystachya</i>, it is wavy or
undulating in the leaves of a few grasses. For example, the upper
epidermis in the leaves of <i>Panicum fluitans</i> is undulating as it
follows the contour of the ridges and furrows.</p>

<p>The epidermal cells have even surfaces in the leaves of most
grasses but in some they bulge out. In the leaves of <i>Panicum
flavidum</i> the cells of the lower epidermis are quite even, whilst
those of the upper epidermis bulge out. The cells of both the
upper and the lower epidermis are distinctly bulging out in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>leaves of <i>Panicum colonum</i>. In <i>Panicum fluitans</i> the cells of the
upper epidermis bulge out so much as to form distinct papill&aelig;.</p>

<p>The free surface of the epidermis is more or less cutinised in
the leaves of all grasses. In some leaves the cuticle is very thick
and even papillate as in the leaves of <i>Aristida setacea</i> and <i>Panicum
repens</i> whilst in others it is very thin, as in the leaves of <i>Panicum
colonum</i> and <i>P. fluitans</i>. Cutinisation is rather prominent in the
leaves of grasses growing under dry conditions and it is less
pronounced in mesophytic grasses.</p>

<p>As regards size, the epidermal cells overlying the sclerenchyma
are small and those lying over parenchyma are larger. Amongst
the larger cells some may be motor-cells. The stomata occur in
regular rows between the vascular bundles and they are quite
characteristic of grasses. They are more or less similar in structure
in all grasses. In the leaves of many grasses stomata are found in
both the upper and the lower epidermis and they are confined to
the lower epidermis in a few grasses only.</p>

<p>The motor-cells vary very much both as regards their shape and
position. In some leaves as in the leaves of the grass <i>Panicum
flavidum</i> the motor-cells are confined to the midrib on the upper
surface.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>In the case of most grasses the motor-cells are found in groups
of three, four or five between the vascular bundles. The central
motor-cell is usually the largest and it is somewhat obovate in
shape in a transverse section of the leaf. In the leaves of <i>Panicum
javanicum</i> and <i>Eriochloa polystachya</i> there are three or four motor
cells in the group and the group consists of four, five or rarely six
motor cells in the leaves of <i>Eragrostis Willdenoviana</i>. When there
are distinct furrows between ridges these cells lie in the furrows
and they are many in number. In the leaves of <i>Panicum repens</i>
there are five to seven motor-cells in the furrows and the single
row of cells stretched between the motor-cells and the lower
epidermis in the furrow consists of more or less clear cells with
sparsely scattered small chlorophyll grains. (See fig. 52.) The
motor-cells occupying the furrows in the leaves of <i>Aristida setacea</i>
are more in number than in <i>Panicum repens</i> and are of a different
shape. All the cells lying in the furrow between the motor-cells
and the sclerenchyma are clear cells free from chlorophyll grains.</p>

<p>Although the motor-cells differ in shape from the ordinary
epidermal cells in most grasses, there are, however, a few grasses
in which the motor-cells do not differ very much from the epidermal
cells except in size. For example, in the leaves of <i>Panicum
colonum</i> the motor-cells are just like the ordinary epidermal cells in
shape but are larger. (See fig. 64.)</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>Motor-cells are usually confined to the upper epidermis, but they
may also be found in the lower epidermis. In the leaves of
<i>Pennisetum cenchroides</i> motor-cells are found in both the upper
and the lower epidermis, the group in the upper epidermis alternating
with that in the lower.</p>

CLASSIFICATION.</h2>


<p>The family Gramine&aelig; is usually divided into two series taking
into consideration the presence or absence of a joint in the pedicel
or rachis, the number of flowers in the spikelet and the position
of the fertile flower. All the species in which there is a joint
just below the spikelet, in the pedicel, in the rachis, or at the base
of a cluster of spikelets come under one series <b>Panicace&aelig;</b>. The
spikelets of the grasses coming under this series, when mature, fall
away singly by themselves, or with their pedicels, or in groups
with portions of the rachis. The spikelets are all similar and
consist of usually four glumes. Each spikelet contains a single
perfect flower and sometimes in addition a staminate flower just
below the perfect flower. In this series the tendency for imperfection
is always confined to the lower flowers, the terminal flower
alone being perfect. For inclusion under this series the grass
plant should have both the characters, articulation and position of
the flower as mentioned above.</p>

<p>The second series <b>Poace&aelig;</b> includes those grasses in which the
spikelets are one to many-flowered and continuous with their
pedicels. But the rachilla of the spikelet may be jointed just
above the empty glumes or between the flowering glumes. The
complete flower is the lowest and the tendency for imperfection is
in the upper flowers.</p>

<p>Of the two series the Panicace&aelig; appears to be more highly
developed than the Poace&aelig;.</p>

Series I&mdash;Panicace&aelig;.<br />

TRIBE I&mdash;PANICE&AElig;.</h2>


<p>This is a fairly large and important tribe flourishing mostly in
the warm regions and the tropics. It is very well represented in
South India and fifteen genera are met with.</p>

<p>The inflorescence varies very much within this tribe and
consists of spikes, racemes and panicles. The spikelets are usually
four-glumed and contain one terminal perfect flower and a staminate
or neutral flower below. But in the genus Isachne both the
flowers are perfect. In some grasses the spikelets contain only
staminate or pistillate flowers. In Coix and Polytoca the plant
bears both male and female spikelets in the same inflorescence,
but in Zea on the same plant they occur as distinct inflorescences.
The littoral grass Spinifex is di&oelig;cious.</p>

<p>The first glume of the spikelet is the smallest. In Panicum it is
nearly two-thirds or less than the third glume. It is very small in
Digitaria and entirely suppressed in Paspalum. In Eriochloa it is
reduced to a minute ridge lying just close to the swollen ring-like
joint of the rachilla. The second and the third glumes are more
or less equal and similar in texture. The fourth glume becomes
firm and rigid along with its palea and usually encloses the
grain.</p>

<p>The pedicel is jointed in some genera and in others it is continuous
with the spikelet and not jointed. When mature the
spikelets fall away either by themselves, singly with their pedicels
or in groups with portions of rachis, according to the position of
the joint. Bristles (branchlets) are often found on the pedicels.
In Setaria a few are borne by the pedicels. The bristles form a
regular involucre at the base of a group of spikelets in Pennisetum,
and in Cenchrus these become united at the base into a mass
forming a kind of burr around the spikelets.</p>

<h3>1. Paspalum, <i>L.</i></h3>

<p>These are annuals or perennials. The spikelets are plano-convex,
orbicular to oblong, obtuse, secund, 2-ranked on the
flattened or triquetrous rachis of the spike-like branches of a raceme,
one-flowered and falling off entire from the very short or obscure
pedicels. There are three glumes, all more or less equal and
similar. The first and the second glumes are membranous, alike
and as long as the third, the second glume is usually epaleate and
occasionally with a minute palea. The third glume is chartaceous
to sub-coriaceous and paleate. Lodicules are two and small.
Stamens are three. The styles are slender and distinct with
plumose stigmas exserted at the top of the spikelet. Grain is
tightly enclosed in the third glume and its palea.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<h4><b>Paspalum scrobiculatum, <i>L.</i></b></h4>

<p>This is an annual grass, with stems tufted on very short
rhizomes, erect or very shortly bent at base, glabrous, bifariously
leafy and varying in height from 1 to 3 feet or more.</p>

<p><i>Leaf-sheaths</i> are compressed, glabrous, loose, keeled, mouth
hairy or not. The <i>ligule</i> is a short thin membrane. The <i>nodes</i> are
glabrous.</p>

<p>The <i>leaf-blade</i> is linear-lanceolate, finely acuminate, keeled with
a distinct midrib, and with very minutely serrulate margins, 6 to
18 inches by 1/12 to 1/3 inch.</p>

<p>The <i>inflorescence</i> consists of 2 to 5 sessile alternate spikes,
usually distant and spreading and varying in length from 1 to 8
inches; the rachis is flattened and winged.</p>

<p>The <i>spikelets</i> are either orbicular or ovate-oblong, as broad as
the rachis, glabrous, closely imbricating in two rows (rarely in three
or four rows), sessile or rarely geminate on a common pedicel.</p>

<p>There are three glumes. The <i>first glume</i> is concave, 3- to 5-nerved
(rarely 3- to 7-nerved). The <i>second glume</i> is flat, 5-nerved, with two
strong sub-marginal nerves, sometimes with shallow transverse pits
along the margins. The <i>third glume</i> is thickly coriaceous, brownish,
shining, minutely striolate, margins roundly incurved throughout its
length, paleate; the <i>palea</i> is similar to the glume in structure and
colour, margins strongly inflexed and with two broad membranous
auricles almost overlapping just below the middle. There are
three <i>stamens</i>. The <i>stigmas</i> are white both when young and
while fading. The style branches are diverging widely and then
straight. There are two oblong cuneate fleshy <i>lodicules</i>.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>and another with ovate oblong spikelets. They also vary in the
size of the spikelets&mdash;some forms have small spikelets and others
large. Sometimes the spikelets show variation in the number of
glumes.</p>

<p>This grass is also cultivated for its grain. In cultivated forms
the spikelets are larger and the whole plant grows bigger. It is
grown both in wet and dry land.</p>

<h3>4. Panicum, <i>L.</i></h3>

<p>The grasses of this genus are annual or perennial and of various
habits. Inflorescence is either a raceme of spikes or, a lax or contracted
panicle. Spikelets are small, solitary or two to four, rarely
more ranked, 1- to 2-flowered, ovoid or oblong, rounded, or dorsally
or laterally compressed, falling entire with the pedicels. There
are four glumes in a spikelet. The first two glumes are empty and
the first glume is small (sometimes minute) and fewest nerved.
The second glume is equal or very nearly equal to the third glume,
oblong-ovate or lanceolate, 5- to many-nerved. The third glume is
similar to the second, male or neuter, paleate or not, 3- to 9-nerved.
The fourth glume is chartaceous, sometimes shortly stalked, ovate-oblong
or lanceolate, hardened in the fruit, smooth or rough,
bisexual, paleate; the palea is as long and of the same texture as the
glume. Lodicules are cuneate or quadrate and two in number.
There are three stamens and an ovary with two style branches
ending in feathery stigmas. Grain is free and enclosed by the
hardened fourth glume and its palea.</p>

<h4><b>Panicum Isachne, <i>Roth.</i></b></h4>

<p>This is an annual grass usually growing in tufts with fine
fibrous roots and many slender spreading branches, all of them
at first creeping and horizontal, rooting at the nodes and then
becoming erect and varying in length from 1 to 2 feet.</p>

<p>Stems are very slender, glabrous or covered with scattered
hairs, purplish or pale green, and branching freely towards the
base.</p>

<p>The <i>leaf-sheath</i> is shorter than the internodes, green or purplish,
striate, externally hairy with scattered bulbous-based hairs,
varying in length from 1/2 to 3 inches, the outer margin of the
sheath is ciliate with long hairs and at the mouths sometimes long
hairs are present, especially when the leaves are young. The
<i>ligule</i> is merely a dense fringe of long hairs. <i>Nodes</i> are tumid,
purplish, covered with long hairs.</p>

<p>The <i>leaf-blade</i> is flat but convolute when young, lanceolate or
linear-lanceolate, acuminate, base rounded and margin with
minute serrations. It is glabrous or occasionally hairy with
scattered, tubercle-based, deciduous hairs, and varying in length
from 1 to 3 inches generally (sometimes in well-grown plants it is
5 inches) and in breadth from 1/8 to 1/4 inch. The midrib is prominent
though slender at the base and four veins are present on each
side with five or six smaller ones between them.</p>

<p>The <i>inflorescence</i> is an erect, narrow panicle consisting of spikes
varying in number from 5 to 12 and in length from 2 to 3 inches.
The <i>spikes</i> are erect, pressed to the very slender rachis, longer than
the internodes of the main rachis, stalked or sessile, mostly simple
but sometimes the lower dividing into two or three branches, 1/2 to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
1 inch long. The rachis of the spike is very slender, angular,
flexuous, narrower than the spikelets, scaberulous with a few long
cilia at the angles.</p>

<p>The <i>spikelets</i> are very small, 1/16 inch long, turned all to one side
and closely packed in two rows, oblong or oval-oblong, obtuse or
subacute, softly hairy, pale green or purplish, with very short
pedicels which are pubescent with a few long hairs towards the
thickened cupular tips.</p>

<p>There are four <i>glumes</i> in the spikelet. The <i>first glume</i> is very
small, membranous, glabrous, broader than long, cordate or
triangular, broadly but shallowly emarginate, nerveless or very
obscurely 1- to 2-nerved. The <i>second glume</i> is pale or purplish, 5-nerved,
hairy, as long as the third glume, membranous, oblong and
obtuse. The <i>third glume</i> is pale, nearly equal to the second glume
with a longitudinal depression at the back, less hairy than the
second glume, 3-nerved (rarely 5-nerved also); <i>palea</i> is present, and
it is hyaline, shorter than the glume, truncate or shallowly retuse,
usually barren but occasionally with three stamens. The <i>fourth
glume</i> is oblong, rounded, coriaceous, smooth, shining, dorsally
flattened, 3- or indistinctly 5-nerved; <i>palea</i> is similar to the glume
in texture and with folded margins. There are three <i>stamens</i>
with yellow anthers. <i>Lodicules</i> are two, very small and distinct.
<i>Ovary</i> has two styles with feathery <i>stigmas</i> white at first, but
turning deep purple while withering.</p>

<p>This delicate and small grass occurs here and there as mere
tufts especially in sheltered situations. It usually flourishes in
black cotton soils amidst cholam (<i>Andropogon Sorghum</i>), although
it thrives equally well in other rich soils. This is considered to
be a very good fodder grass.</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&mdash;It is fairly common all over the Madras Presidency,
and goes up to 3,000 or 4,000 feet. It occurs in Africa,
America and Italy.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

flattened below, erect or slightly recurved.</p>

<p>The <i>spikelets</i> are white, in two rows on a flattened rachis,
obliquely ovoid or gibbously globose, glabrous, sessile, 1/8 inch in
length.</p>

<p>There are four <i>glumes</i>. The <i>first glume</i> is suborbicular, about
half the length of the third glume, usually 3-nerved. The <i>second
glume</i> is broadly ovate, obtuse, concave, larger than the first glume
and nearly equal to or shorter than the fourth glume, 7-nerved,
rarely 7- to 9-nerved, nerves are anastomosing, tip rounded. The

angular, grooved, scabrid on the ridges. The <i>spikes</i> are 7 to 10
inches, alternate, pale green or purplish, rather distant, spreading
or suberect (never erect) 1/2 to 1-1/2 inches long, sessile and with a
tuft of bristly hairs at the base; the rachis of the spike is angular,
grooved with scattered bulbous-based bristles on the ridges.</p>

<p>The <i>spikelets</i> are four ranked, ovoid-lanceolate, 1/8 to 1/6 inch
long without the awn, somewhat flattened on one side and gibbous
on the other, pale green or purplish, with equal bulbous-based
bristly hairs on the nerves.</p>

<p>There are four <i>glumes</i>. The <i>first glume</i> is half of the third glume,
thin, membranous, hairy, broadly ovate, abruptly cuspidate at the
apex, and acuminate, 5-nerved (rarely 3-nerved). The <i>second glume</i>
is broadly ovate-lanceolate, concave, acuminate, short awned, 5-nerved
with two partial nerves one on each side of the central
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>nerve (7- to 9-nerved at the tip), hairs on nerves, a few tubercled.
The <i>third glume</i> is similar to the second, broadly ovate-lanceolate,
awned, awn 1/8 to 1/4 inch, paleate with usually three stamens,
occasionally neuter. <i>Lodicules</i> are present. The <i>fourth glume</i> is
chartaceous, shining, smooth ovate-oblong, apex cuspidate, with a
few hairs on the edges at the apex, faintly 5-nerved. The <i>anthers</i>
within this glume come out before those of the third glume.
<i>Anthers</i> are three, yellowish and <i>lodicules</i> are conspicuous though
small.</p>

<p>In this grass very often, purple streaks or bands occur across
the leaf blades and the sheath and the spikelets become purple on
one side as is met with in P. colonum. This grass is occasionally
found in the paddy fields either alone, or along with <i>Panicum
Crus-galli</i>.</p>

<p>This plant occurs widely as a weed of cultivation in black cotton
as well as other kinds of soil and shows variation in its leaves and
spikelets. In some plants growing in somewhat dry places the
leaves are shorter and broader, and those in favourable situations
have longer narrower leaves. The spikelets are either perfectly
glabrous or pubescent and long hairs may or may not be present
on the pedicels. As regards colour the whole plant is green or the
exposed portions of stems and spikelets are purplish. This grass
is liked by cattle and is one of the most nutritious of Indian
fodder grasses.</p>

<p>This grass flourishes in moist situations such as the bunds of
paddy fields, tank beds and edges of marshes and is an excellent
binder of the soil. When once established it is very difficult to get

TRIBES II AND III&mdash;ORYZE&AElig; AND ZOYSIE&AElig;.</h2>


<p><b>Oryze&aelig;</b> is a very small tribe with a few genera, which usually
flourish in marshes. The spikelets are in panicles, 1-flowered
and the flower is usually perfect. In Oryza there are three glumes,
the first two being very minute, and there is only a single glume in
Leersia and Hygrorhiza. There are usually six stamens. The
palea becomes firm in texture like the glume instead of remaining
hyaline, and so it is often mistaken for a glume. The spikelets
are jointed on their pedicels and fall away from them.</p>

TRIBE IV&mdash;ANDROPOGONE&AElig;.</h2>


<p>Andropogone&aelig; is a very large tribe with about thirty genera.
It is very well represented in South India and some genera are of
very wide distribution.</p>

<p>The spikelets are usually arranged in pairs at each joint, one
sessile and the other stalked. The spikelets may all be similar as
in Imperata or they may be different as in <ins title="Isach&aelig;mum in original">Isch&aelig;mum</ins> and
Andropogon. There may be only one flower in the spikelet as in
Eremochloa and Saccharum or two as in Isch&aelig;mum and Apocopis.
In the genera Polytoca and Coix the spikelets are unisexual and
the male and female spikelets are found in the same inflorescence,
the female being below and the male being continuous with it.
The spikelet nearly always consists of four glumes, the first or the
first and the second being firmer and coriaceous or chartaceous.
The flowering glumes are always shorter than the empty glumes,
and are hyaline. The fourth glume is often awned or reduced to
an awn.</p>

<p>The main rachis of the inflorescence is usually jointed at the
base. In addition to this the rachis may be jointed all along its
length, so as to become separated into distinct joints when mature
as in Rottboellia, Saccharum and Andropogon, or it may be
continuous as in Imperata. The pedicels of spikelets and the
lower portions of the rachilla of the spikelets may have long hairs.</p>

<h3>24. Apluda, <i>L.</i></h3>

<p>These are tall leafy slender perennial grasses, with branching
stems erect or geniculately ascending from a creeping or decumbent
base. The inflorescence is a leafy panicle of many small spikes
enclosed in spathiform bracts. Spikes are of one linear joint
gibbously bulbous at the base, and jointed on the peduncle at the
base of the spathe by a minute curved pedicel. Spikelets are
three, a sessile, 2-flowered bisexual one in front, and two pedicelled
ones behind, one of which is imperfect and reduced to a glume and
the other perfect male or rarely bisexual. The two pedicels are
flat, prolonged from one side of the rounded rachis, oblong linear,
truncate with a few long hairs along the margin. Sessile spikelets
have four glumes. The first glume is chartaceous, linear oblong,
many-nerved, shortly bifid at the apex, longer than the other
glumes. The second glume is thinner, dorsally gibbous, keeled, 5-

<h3>25. Rottboellia, <i>Linn. f.</i></h3>

<p>These are tall, annual or perennial grasses, with leafy stems
and narrow leaves. The spikes are few or many, solitary or
panicled, with a jointed usually fragile rachis; the joints are
rounded or compressed, hollowed on one side and excavated at the
tip. The spikelets are usually binate, one-sessile closing or sunk
in the cavity of the joint and the other pedicelled, smaller than the
sessile or rudimentary with the pedicel usually adnate to the joints
and equal to or shorter than it. The sessile spikelets are bisexual,
1- to 2-flowered, equal to or shorter than the joint and four-glumed.
The first glume is coriaceous dorsally flattened, obtuse,
margins narrowly incurved. The second glume is thinner than the
first, broadly ovate, acute and gibbously convex. The third glume
is hyaline, ovate, acute, male or neuter, with a membranous palea.
The fourth glume is hyaline, bisexual, broadly ovate, acute with a
hyaline, ovate-lanceolate palea. There are three stamens with
linear anthers. There are two cuneate lodicules. Styles are two
with laterally exserted stigmas. The grain is broadly oblong.
The pedicelled spikelets are smaller than the sessile, male or
neuter, with four glumes. The first glume is herbaceous, many-nerved,
ovate-acute, minutely bifid at the apex. The second, third
and the fourth are more or less similar to those of the sessile
spikelet.</p>

on all directions, bent below and erect above; they vary in length
from 6 inches to 18 inches, but sometimes when growing under
favourable conditions attain the length of 2-1/2 feet. The stem is
slender, green, or pale reddish in the exposed portions and pale
in parts covered by sheaths slightly flattened, smooth.</p>

<p>The <i>leaf-sheaths</i> are smooth, compressed, distinctly keeled. The
<i>ligule</i> is a short, truncate, white, glabrous membrane. The <i>nodes</i>
are glabrous.</p>

<p>The <i>leaf-blade</i> is linear, finely acuminate, glabrous, but sometimes
somewhat scabrid along the nerves and with scattered long delicate
hairs above especially when young, varying in length from 1 to
7 inches and 1/10 to 1/8 inch in breadth.</p>

<p>The <i>inflorescence</i> consists of paired spikes with very slender
peduncles arising from flattened, glabrous, acuminate spathes,
varying in length from 1/2 to 1-1/4 inches. The <i>spikes</i> are spreading
and one of them always slightly longer than the other, reddish or
pale green, 1/2 to 1 inch long; the <i>rachis</i> consists of five to eight

<p>These are tall grasses, annual or perennial. Leaves are usually
long and narrow. The inflorescence consists of racemes or panicles
of fascicled spikes in the axils of spathiform bracts. The
spikelets vary in number from six to eleven in a cluster, the four
lowest being male or neuter, and forming an involucre with whorled
or superposed pairs round either 1-sessile bisexual spikelet with
two pedicelled spikelets or two superposed bisexual, the lower
with one pedicelled, the upper with two.</p>

<p>The involucral spikelets are male or neuter, the largest, and consist
of three glumes. The first glume is oblong, lanceolate, dorsally
flattened, many-nerved, margins narrowly incurved and keels
narrowly winged. The second glume is membranous, lanceolate,
acute, 3-nerved, with ciliate margins. The third glume is hyaline,
smaller than the second, 1-nerved or this glume may be absent,
stamens have large anthers. The pedicelled spikelets are similar to
the involucral in every respect but smaller, male or neuter, but the
first glume is not winged on the keels. The bisexual (or female)
spikelets are smaller than the <ins title="involucral used more often">involucrant</ins> spikelets, linear-oblong,
subterete, obtuse with a rigidly bearded callus. There are four
glumes in the spikelet. The first glume is terete, or dorsally compressed
or channelled, coriaceous and at length hardened, margins
incurved, dark brown to almost black when old. The second glume
is as long as the first, linear, dorsally chartaceous, with broadly incurved
membranous margins, 3-nerved. The third glume is very
small, hyaline, 1-nerved, epaleate. The fourth glume is the flattened
base of the awn, epaleate. The lodicules are two, cuneate.
Anthers are rather small. Styles are laterally or terminally
exserted. Grain is narrow, obovoid, biconvex, with two grooves on

<h3>30. Iseilema, <i>Hack.</i></h3>

<p>These grasses are either annual or perennial, with slender freely
branching stems. The inflorescence is a panicle consisting of
groups of dissimilar spikelets with compressed, boat-shaped spathes
on peduncles. Spikelets are of two kinds, sessile and pedicelled.
Each peduncle bears 4-pedicelled male or neuter spikelets in a
regular whorl forming an involucel around 1 or 2 sessile bisexual
spikelets and 2- or 3-pedicelled male spikelets. Involucral spikelets
have 3 or 2 glumes, the first two glumes are somewhat similar, the
first 3- to 5-nerved and the second 3-nerved, the third glume is one
nerved and hyaline. Lodicules are cuneate and retuse. Anthers
yellow dotted or tinged violet. Pedicelled spikelets inside the involucral
similar to those of the involucral. Sessile spikelets are
bisexual or sometimes female, 4-glumed and awned.</p>

<h4><b>Sporobolus diander, <i>Beauv.</i></b></h4>

<p>This is a tufted annual or perennial grass. Stems are slender
with leaves tufted at the base, 1 to 3 feet high.</p>

<p>The <i>leaf-sheath</i> is glabrous and smooth, ribbed, the lower short
and the upper very long. <i>Nodes</i> are glabrous. The <i>ligule</i> consists
of a fringe of minute hairs.</p>

<p>The <i>leaf-blades</i> are usually flat, glabrous, strongly nerved, with
filiform tips, 3 to 10 inches by 1/25 to 1/16 inch.</p>

<p>The <i>inflorescence</i> is an erect narrow pyramidal panicle, varying
in length from 4 to 10 inches and about 2 inches in breadth. The
branches are very fine, spreading and in scattered fascicles, 1/2 to
2 inches long, with many very small spikelets arranged racemosely
along the axis. <i>Spikelets</i> are small 1/18 to 1/20 inch long, with very
short pedicels. The <i>first glume</i> is very short less than 1/5 inch,
broadly oblong, nerveless, hyaline, broadly truncate and erose at
the apex. The <i>second glume</i> is a little longer than the first, but
shorter than the third, hyaline, broadly elliptic-oblong, nerveless
or obscurely 1-nerved. The <i>third glume</i> is broadly ovate-oblong,
subacute, 1-nerved, paleate; the <i>palea</i> is plicate in the median
line. Stamens are usually two. The grain is obovoid, truncate at
the apex, and with a small white swelling in the centre at the
apex, rugulose, red-brown.</p>

<p>This grass grows usually gregariously in somewhat sheltered
situations all over the Presidency on the plains and low hills.
This is an excellent fodder grass. It forms fairly large tufts with
plenty of green leaves on rich moist soils. When the leaves are
young cattle eat this grass very eagerly, but do not seem to care
for it when the leaves become old. However by frequent grazing
it can be made to produce young leaves in succession. This grass
is also an excellent soil binder, as its roots form a perfect matting
in any kind of moist soil soon after planting. This is very difficult
to eradicate when once established.</p>

<h4><b>Sporobolus tremulus, <i>Kunth.</i></b></h4>

<p>A small tufted perennial grass.</p>

<p>The plant consists of prostrate stems and stolons, filiform and
wiry. Stems vary in length from 2 to 18 inches, prostrate or erect,
rooting at the lower nodes; flowering branches always ascending.</p>

<p>The <i>leaf-sheath</i> is glabrous, finely striate, shorter than the internode.
The <i>ligule</i> is a very short ciliated membrane.</p>

<p>The <i>leaf-blade</i> is narrow linear, pungent, somewhat rigid, flat,
distichous, base rounded with or without a few long hairs and
varies in length from 1/4 to 1 inch and in breadth from 1/20 to 1/16
inch, but in plants growing in rich moist soils the leaves become
longer reaching 3-1/2 inches in length.</p>

<p>The <i>inflorescence</i> is a narrow spiciform panicle with appressed
branches and spikelets, sometimes interrupted, varying in length
from 3/4 to 1-1/4 inch; both the peduncle and the main rachis are
glabrous, and the latter wavy.</p>

<p>In Flora of British India, this plant is included under Sporobolus
coromandelianus. These two plants (<i>S. coromandelianus</i> and <i>S.
commutatus</i>) are quite distinct and grow side by side. As the
differences are not easily seen in herbarium specimens the two
plants are put together under the one species <i>S. coromandelianus</i>.
The branches are tufted and are usually decumbent at base, leaves
quite green and somewhat broad in <i>S. coromandelianus</i>; and in <i>S.
commutatus</i>, branches are usually not decumbent at base, generally
erect from the base and leaves are green glaucous and somewhat
narrow. The most striking difference, however, is in the panicle.
The branches of the panicle are always stiff and horizontal in S.
coromandelianus and the spikelets are appressed to the branches
and never spreading or drooping, whereas in <i>S. commutatus</i> the
branches are never stiff and horizontal, always obliquely ascending
and the spikelets are spreading and drooping. Judging from
living plants these two are undoubtedly distinct and so this plant
is treated as a distinct species retaining Kunth's name <i>Sporobolus
commutatus</i>. Enumeratio Plantarum, Pl. I, 214.</p>

<h3>33. Gracilea, <i>Koen.</i></h3>

<p>These are small tufted grasses. The inflorescence is a spike
bearing unilaterally turbinate clusters of spikelets which are
2-flowered. The spikelets have usually four, and rarely six glumes
and very often the rachilla is produced beyond the fourth glume.
The first and the second glumes are narrow (the first being the
narrowest), rigid, ciliate with long hairs and awned. The third
glume is bisexual, chartaceous, broadly ovate, 3-nerved, shortly
awned. The fourth glume is similar to the third but smaller and
male. The fifth and sixth glumes when present are small and
empty. Lodicules are two and small. Grain linear oblong.</p>

This grass differs from <i>Cynodon dactylon</i>, Pers. (1) in not having
underground stems and having only stems creeping and rooting
along the surface of the ground, (2) in having less rigid leaves, (3)
by having longer, slenderer, somewhat drooping spikes and
narrower spikelets, (4) by having the first two glumes always
unequal, the second being longer, (5) by having clavellate pointed
hairs on the margins and keels of the third glume and (6) by

<h4><b>Chloris incompleta, <i>Roth.</i></b></h4>

<p>This is a perennial grass. Stems are procumbent when growing
in open places, but erect if growing amidst bushes, often branched,
ending in long naked peduncles, varying in length from 1-1/2 to 4
feet. In some cases prostrate stems produce roots at the nodes.</p>

<p>The <i>leaf-sheaths</i> are long, glabrous, the mouth being generally
hairy. The <i>ligule</i> consists of long hairs. <i>Nodes</i> are glabrous.</p>

<p>The <i>leaf-blades</i> are linear, flat, finely acuminate and narrowed into
very long points at the apex; glabrous or slightly hairy at the base
and contracted, 4 to 10 inches long and 1/6 to 1/4 inch broad.</p>

<p>The <i>inflorescence</i> consists of two to five rarely six, very slender
spikes, 3 to 8 inches long, forming a terminal whorl. The rachis is
fine and scabrid.</p>

is as long as the second or longer, coriaceous, obovate and truncate
at the top, 3-nerved and the marginal nerves distant from the
margin, keel and the lateral nerves villous to about three-fourths
their length, scabrid at the apex close to the truncate margin,
paleate; <i>palea</i> is elliptic, with ciliate margins, callus is densely
villous. The <i>fourth glume</i> is nearly half or a little more than half of
the third glume, narrower, paleate; <i>palea</i> is elliptic. The succeeding
glumes <i>fifth</i> to the <i>eighth</i> are similar to the fourth in shape but
they get smaller and smaller and the last glume is epaleate. The
third glume is usually grain bearing, but rarely the fourth also

rooting base, varying in length from 1 to 3 feet and with internodes
to 6 inches becoming longer upwards.</p>

<p>The <i>leaf-sheaths</i> are equal to or longer than the internodes at the
base, but shorter above, glabrous, compressed, distichous, bearded
towards the mouth and with membranous margins. The <i>ligule</i> is

usually 3- to 4-awned and sometimes 5-awned; <i>awns</i> are purplish
3/16 to 5/16 inch long, finely scabrid. There are five or seven <i>glumes</i>
in a spikelet. The <i>first glume</i> is hyaline, purplish or pale, about 1/10
inch long, lanceolate, sub-acuminate, 1-nerved with a scaberulous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>keel. The <i>second glume</i> is hyaline, about one and half times as long
as the first, oblong elliptic, minutely 2-lobed at the apex, with a
minute mucro between, 1-nerved with a scabrid keel. The <i>third
glume</i> is as long as the second, awned, pale or purple, ovate or
obovate, narrowed at the base and clasping the rachilla at its base,
apex shortly 2-fid with a purple dorsal awn, 3-nerved paleate; the
two marginal nerves are densely bearded with long white or purple
tinged hairs from near the base to almost the apex and the mid-nerve
also similarly bearded with long hairs on both sides, and
the base with a tuft of long hairs; the palea is as long as the glume,
coriaceous obovately-cuneate, obtuse, minutely bifid, purple-tipped,
with folded hyaline margins, 2-keeled; keels shortly ciliate. <i>Stamens</i>
three with yellow or purple anthers, <i>ovary</i> with two feathery
<i>stigmas</i> and two <i>lodicules</i>. Grain is oblong shining light reddish
brown, narrowed at both ends and somewhat trigonous. The
remaining glumes <i>fourth</i> to <i>seventh</i> are borne by the rachilla, thinly
chartaceous, broadly obcordate or obovate, gradually diminishing
in size, purple-tinged, 3- to 5-nerved, scaberulous. The fourth
and fifth glumes are empty and epaleate when the spikelets are five
glumed. If there are six glumes, the <i>fourth</i> bears stamens and the
ovary, the <i>fifth</i> and <i>sixth glumes</i> are empty, and in spikelets of
seven glumes, the third, fourth, and the fifth glumes are flower-bearing
and contain grains, and the remaining two glumes are
empty.</p>

<p>This species is a tall robust one resembling <i>Chloris barbata</i> in
its inflorescence, but with larger spikelets&mdash;as large as those of
<i>Chloris tenella</i>. No doubt it is closely allied to <i>Chloris barbata</i>, but
differs from it by having larger spikelets that are 3- to 5-awned
and 1- to 3-flowered, and the nerves being bearded throughout
their length with long hairs.</p>

<p>Specimens of this grass were sent to Kew and Calcutta herbariums
for identification and they were named <i>C. montana</i>, with
which I could not agree.</p>

<p>So again I sent these specimens along with specimens of what
I considered <i>C. montana</i> to Dr. Stapf at Kew through Mr. Gamble
and Dr. Stapf wrote about these thus:&mdash;"We have not been able
to match it with any of the described species of <i>Chloris</i> and Mr.
Ranga Acharya will be fully justified in describing it as a new
species. We have had it apart from Wight's specimen from the
following collections:&mdash;(1) Sattur, November 19, 1795, sub-Andropogon
barbata, Var.? Herb Rottler. (2) Ahmednagar-Miss
Shattock (U.S. Dept. Agri.&mdash;received 1914). (3)Tornagallu, Bellary

<p>This grass is perennial with wiry roots. Stems are erect
ascending from a swollen woody base, thinly hairy and rarely
glabrous, pale green and sometimes with red blotches, wiry, varying
in length from 1 to 3 feet.</p>

<p>The <i>leaf-sheath</i> is thinly pubescent, some hairs being minutely
gland-tipped.</p>

<p>The <i>leaf-blade</i> is narrow, linear-lanceolate, sharply acuminate,
covered both above and below with hairs, many of which being
minutely gland-tipped, convolute when young. The <i>ligule</i> is a
ridge of hairs. Nodes are pubescent.</p>

<p>The <i>inflorescence</i> is a panicle with short branches, 1 to 3 inches
long, rachis is pubescent; peduncle is 2 to 4 inches long, pubescent.
The <i>spikelets</i> are pale green, sometimes purple tinged and
appearing white when mature, softly pubescent, about 1/4 inch long
including the awn; the rachilla is produced and disarticulates
above the two lower glumes.</p>

<p>There are 6 or 7 glumes in the spikelet. The <i>first glume</i> is lanceolate,
acute, softly hairy, usually 9-nerved, or varying from 7 to 12
(some nerves do not reach the apex), about 1/4 inch long. The <i>second
glume</i> is similar to the first but a little longer and both the glumes
have broad hyaline margins. The <i>third glume</i> is broadly orbicular,
concave, sub-chartaceous, 9-nerved, densely villous and with a tuft
of hairs at the base where it joins the rachilla, cleft into 9 awn-like
lobes, bisexual and paleate; the awns are alternately long and
short, subulate, plumose in the lower half and scabrid above, the
palea is oblong-ovate, sub-chartaceous, with two pubescent keels,
bifid at the apex, and with 3 purple anthers. The <i>ovary</i> is ovoid
or ovoid-oblong, with two white stigmas. <i>Lodicules</i> are two, small
cuneate or quadrate. Grain ovoid or ovoid-oblong. The <i>fourth</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
<i>glume</i> is similar to the third glume but smaller, paleate with rudimentary
anthers and two fleshy lodicules. The <i>fifth</i>, <i>sixth</i> and

<h3>42. Eragrostis, <i>Beauv.</i></h3>

<p>These are slender, glabrous, annual or perennial grasses. Stems
are usually erect or geniculately ascending, very rarely prostrate.
Leaves are narrow. Inflorescences are open or contracted panicles,
rarely spikes. Spikelets are usually strongly laterally compressed,
2, to many-flowered and not articulate at the base; rachilla is
tough and persistent, jointed above the empty glumes and in some
also between the flowering glumes, not produced beyond the last
glume. Glumes are many, broad, obtuse, acute or mucronate,
never awned, dorsally rounded and keeled; the first and the second
glumes are much shorter than the spikelet, equal or unequal, empty,
persistent or separately deciduous, 1-nerved or the second 3-nerved,
usually membranous. Flowering glumes are imbricating, at
length deciduous from the rachilla, 3-nerved, all bisexual or the
uppermost and rarely the lowest imperfect, ovate to lanceolate,
membranous to chartaceous, usually glabrous, the lateral nerves
short not reaching the mid nerve; palea are broad, membranous,
deciduous with its glume or persistent on the rachilla with two
ciliate smooth or scabrid keels. Stamens are three rarely two.
Ovary is glabrous with two styles ending in plumose stigmas.
Grain is minute, globose, obgloboid or obovoid, free in the glume
and the palea.</p>
